      Write in a casual, reflective tone that avoids first-person perspective (no 'I', 'we', or 'you'). Don't frame it as dialogue or direct conversation, but as thoughtful observations about the topic. Don't quote scripture directly - assume the ideas are being reflected on from memory without reference materials. Use natural, everyday language rather than academic or sermonic phrasing. The content should feel like overhearing someone's authentic thoughts, not like they're addressing an audience or speaking to themselves. Focus on relatable insights and practical applications without religious jargon. The tone should be warm and conversational but without explicitly acknowledging a listener.
      
      The "interpretation" field in the JSON MUST be at least 600 words and follow these rules.
