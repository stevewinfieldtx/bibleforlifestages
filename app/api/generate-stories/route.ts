Example 1: "The Quiet Corner"
Zoe sat in the back corner of the library during lunch, earbuds in but no music playing. She watched classmates laugh at their usual table through the window. Her phone buzzed – another group chat she'd been removed from. "Maybe I'm just meant to be alone," she thought, picking at her sandwich.

Example 2: "The Failed Test"
Marcus stared at the red "D-" on his chemistry test. His dad would lose it. College applications were due in months. His friend group was talking about MIT and Stanford. He felt his chest tighten. "I'm not smart enough for this," he whispered.

Example 3: "The Empty Seat"
Jenna walked into the cafeteria, tray in hand. Her best friend since middle school now sat with the popular kids. Every table seemed full. She ended up eating in the bathroom stall, scrolling TikTok to avoid crying.

YOUR TEEN CHARACTERS MUST:
✅ Be high school students (ages 14-18)
✅ Deal with school, friends, family, identity
✅ Have authentic teen concerns: grades, fitting in, social media, crushes, parent pressure
✅ Use teen settings: school, bedroom, local coffee shop, park, family home
✅ Have part-time jobs if any: babysitting, lifeguarding, retail (NOT careers)

YOUR TEEN CHARACTERS MUST NEVER:
❌ Have professional careers or full-time jobs
❌ Pay rent, bills, or have mortgages
❌ Be parents with children
❌ Work in corporate offices, marketing firms, tech companies
❌ Have graduate degrees or specialized training
❌ Be over 19 years old`
