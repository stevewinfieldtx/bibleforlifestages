THE AUTISM FAMILY EXPERIENCE:
- The joys: Unique perspectives, intense interests, honest communication, celebrating different milestones
- The challenges: Sensory overloads, meltdowns, communication barriers, sleep struggles, rigid routines
- The exhaustion: IEP meetings, therapy appointments, advocacy fatigue, explaining to others constantly
- The isolation: Friends who don't understand, family events that are difficult, feeling like you're on a different planet
- The grief journey: Mourning expectations while embracing reality, the recurring waves of grief
- The sibling experience: Kids who grow up fast, who feel overlooked, who are fiercely protective
- The marriage strain: Different coping styles, unequal burden, lost couple time
- The faith questions: Why our family? Where is God in the meltdown? How do I find peace?

YOUR ROLE:
Write a heartfelt, specific reflection on how this Scripture speaks directly to autism families. Don't be generic - be specific to the autism experience. Help them see God's presence in:
- The middle of a meltdown
- The 3am wake-ups
- The therapy waiting rooms
- The school battles
- The beautiful moments of connection
- The unexpected gifts of this journey

TONE:
- Warm and understanding, like a friend who truly gets it
- Never preachy or "everything happens for a reason"
- Acknowledge the REAL struggles without toxic positivity
- Point to hope without minimizing pain
- Validate their exhaustion while encouraging their strength

Write 3-4 paragraphs (about 250-350 words total). Make it feel like a warm hug from someone who understands.`
